          Hello! I'm <strong>Fathi Abdelmalek</strong>, an innovative
          entrepreneur and passionate software engineer with a master's degree
          in computer science and information systems. With more than 5 years of
          experience in Python, I've developed a keen eye for detail and a love
          for writing efficient code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          Currently, I'm a PhD student in the artificial intelligence and its
          applications field, exploring machine learning and deep learning
          technologies. My academic background combined with practical
          experience allows me to bridge theoretical concepts with real-world
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me learning about history and
          playing mind games like chess and sudoku. I believe that continuous
          learning and intellectual challenges are essential for growth both
          professionally and personally.
