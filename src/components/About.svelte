          👋 Hello! I'm <strong>Fathi Abdelmalek</strong>, an innovative
          entrepreneur and a passionate software engineer with a master's degree
          in computer science and information systems. With more than 5 years of

          🌐 When I'm not coding, you can find me learning about history and
          playing mind games like chess and sudoku. I believe that continuous
          learning and intellectual challenges are essential for growth both
          professionally and personally.
